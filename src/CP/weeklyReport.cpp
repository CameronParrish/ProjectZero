   /*
     This function will compile the weekly report at the end of
     each week. This will track the statistics for a particular week
     of simulation. This should aggregate the statistics for 7 days
     and make an appropriate report.

     My plan is to import a typesetting library so that I can format
     the report and make it look good. This function will output the
     report to a file as well as the GUI.
